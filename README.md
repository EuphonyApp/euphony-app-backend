# newServer
Backend server for the new Android app I am working on, Euphony, which provides patform for artists to meet others with same or different genres, around their current locations and jam together or form bands.
Venues can signup using Social media accounts and book performances, follow bands and artists.

Technology Stack Used-

Node.js
Express framework,
MongoDB,
Socket.io, for the chat integration,
Retrofit 2.0, for communication between Android client(to be uploaded soon) and backend.
